# Programs
The perceptron algorithms appear in Hal DaumÃ© III, A Course in Machine Learning (v. 0.99 draft), Chapter 4: The Perceptron.

We will write two programs in Python 3: perceplearn.py will learn perceptron models (vanilla and averaged) from the training data, and percepclassify.py will use the models to classify new data. You are encouraged to reuse your own code from Coding Exercise 3 for reading the data and writing the output, so that you can concentrate on implementing the classification algorithm.

The learning program will be invoked in the following way:

> python perceplearn.py /path/to/input

The argument is the directory of the training data; the program will learn perceptron models, and write the model parameters to two files: vanillamodel.txt for the vanilla perceptron, and averagedmodel.txt for the averaged perceptron.

The format of the model files should follow the following guidelines:

The model files should contain sufficient information for percepclassify.py to successfully label new data.
The model files should be human-readable, so that model parameters can be easily understood by visual inspection of the file.
The classification program will be invoked in the following way:

> python percepclassify.py /path/to/model /path/to/input

The first argument is the path to the model file (vanillamodel.txt or averagedmodel.txt), and the second argument is the path to the directory of the test data file; the program will read the parameters of a perceptron model from the model file, classify each entry in the test data, and write the results to a text file called percepoutput.txt in the following format:

label_a label_b path1
label_a label_b path2
